Team Zayana presents, yet again another website project. 'Ruas'

## Background
With the advancement of technology from era to era, it is already naturally becoming a part of our daily lives. This includes technology being a part of the field of education. In this oppurtunity, we as a team try to solve issues from our school and create solutions in the form of a Learning Management System Website (LMS).

## So, what is Ruas?
<strong>Ruas</strong> is a Learning Management System website, that is aimed to solve problems of the students and teachers that are around us. The word 'Ruas' itself has two meanings: an abbreviation of the indonesian word 'Ruang Kelas', and the indonesian word for 'section' - referring to how the site was built in sections.
